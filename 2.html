<h1>Computer Karider Pro license</h1>
<strong>Pro-license</strong> is a level of difficulty that is impossible for ordinary people to obtain.
Pro-license, which is hard for even current professionals, can be obtained by completing three maps, but only by recording records that make no sense, including Gongmacho, Haesombo, and Sulsan.
What's so popular these days is to get a pro-license without a start booster, and it's so difficult that only three people can get it.
